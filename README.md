## ü§î About me

* I use she/her pronouns.
* I'm based in Ipswich, UK.
* I've been an open source advocate for 20+ years.
* I currently work as Project Lead for [Mautic](https://mautic.org).
* I'm a co-founder of the [Women of Open Source](https://womenofopensource.org) community.
* I have the great privilege of speaking regularly at events around the world on a range of topics from open source and tech to living an active life with a disability and my unconventional path to a career in tech.
* I'm proud to be a trustee of [Breathworks](https://www.breathworks-mindfulness.org.uk/), helping people around the world living with pain and suffering.
* I'm an EDS Warrior - living an active and full life with a long-term genetic condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
* I have developed a strange obsession for ultramarathon running!
